# Work done for Week 0 of Final Project (Code Review 4/11)
1. Decided on project idea
2. Decided to use ofSound library for processing and playing audio
3. Compiled and ran example sound projects in openFrameworks
4. Researched Fast Fourier Transform for splitting audio into frequencies

# Work done for Week 1 of Final Project (Code Review 4/18)
1. Explored audio onset detection further, decided against using FFT, instead using RMS
2. Implemented ofxSoundObjects additional add on to get sound buffer from sound player
3. Calculating variance and rms to detect audio onset, drawing a box for now for each detection

# Work to be done for next week
1. Get actual gameplay with keys working
2. Scoring system
3. Fine tune audio onset detection
